TX\ :sup:`2` Documentation
===============================

Welcome to TX\ :sup:`2`! This library is intended to aid in the explorability and explainability of
transformer classification networks, or transformer language models with sequence classification
heads. The basic function of this library is to take a trained transformer and
test/train dataset and produce an ipywidget dashboard as seen in the screenshot below,
which can be displayed in a jupyter notebook or jupyter lab.

NOTE: Currently this library's implementation is partially torch-dependent, and so will
not work with tensorflow/keras models - we hope to address this limitation in the future!
